# Healthcare-Recommender
This repository provides research-oriented implementations and experimental frameworks for healthcare recommender systems, focusing on data-driven decision support, personalized recommendations, and intelligent modeling techniques. The materials are intended to facilitate reproducibility, methodological clarity, and further scholarly exploration in the domain of computational healthcare.

The repository primarily contains code associated with scientific publications authored by Yahya Dorostkar Navaei and Yasar Ahangari Nanehkaran. The implementations reflect the algorithms, experimental designs, and evaluation procedures presented in their respective studies.

This resource is designed for researchers, graduate students, practitioners, and reviewers in scientific journals interested in recommender systems, healthcare analytics, and applied machine learning. Contributions and academic collaboration are welcome.
